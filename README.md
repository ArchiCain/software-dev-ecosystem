# Software Dev Ecosystem

## Overview

This project is designed to provide a scalable and reproducible development environment using [Nix](https://nixos.org/). All dependencies are managed through Nix to ensure consistency across different systems.

### Technologies Used
- **Nix**: To manage and reproduce development environments
- **Homebrew**: MacOS package manager
- **Direnv**: To startup terminals with Nix
- **Yarn**: For Typescript/Javascript package management
- **NX Workspace**: A monorepo for Typescript/JavaScript development

## Setting Up the Development Environment

To set up the environment, follow these steps:

1. **TODO: document Nix installation**
2. **TODO: document installation of direnv and running direnv allow**
3. **TODO: document docker desktop and enabling k8s**
4. **TODO: document NX workspace and plugin setup**
